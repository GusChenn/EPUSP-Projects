# EPUSP-Projects
Projects i've developed while studying at the Escola Plotecnica da Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (EPUSP).

Theese are almost all of the programming exercices (EP's) and laboratory activities that i developed during my graduation.
Feel free to take a look and clone it if you find anything interesting.
